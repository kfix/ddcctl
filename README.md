ddcctl: DDC monitor controls for the OSX command line
----
Adjust your external monitors' built-in controls from the OSX shell:  
* brightness  
* contrast  

And *possibly* (if your monitor firmware is well implemented):  
* input source
* built-in speaker volume  
* on/off/standby
* rgb colors
* color presets
* reset

Install
----
* install Xcode
* figure out if your Mac is using an Intel, Nvidia or AMD gpu
* run `make intel` or make `make nvidia` or `make amd`

Usage
----
Run `ddcctl -h` for some options.  
[ddcctl.sh](/ddcctl.sh) is a script I use to control two PC monitors plugged into my Mac Mini.  
You can point Alfred, ControlPlane, or Karabiner at it to quickly switch presets.

Credits

`ddcctl.m` sprang from a [forum thread](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/controlling-your-monitor-with-osx-ddc-panel.90077/page-6#post-795208) on the TonyMac-x86 boards.  

`DDC.c` originated from [jontaylor/DDC-CI-Tools-for-OS-X](https://github.com/jontaylor/DDC-CI-Tools-for-OS-X), but was reworked by others on the forums.  

A few forks have also backported patches, which is *nice* :ok_hand:.
