ddcctl: DDC monitor controls for the OSX command line
----
Adjust your external monitors' built-in controls from the OSX shell:  
* brightness  
* contrast  

And *possibly* (if your monitor firmware is well implemented):  
* input source  
* built-in speaker volume  
* on/off/standby
* rgb colors
* color presets
* reset

Install
----
```bash
make install
```

For an On-Screen Display using [OSDisplay.app](https://github.com/zulu-entertainment/OSDisplay):  
`make CCFLAGS=-DOSD clean ddcctl`

Usage
----
Run `ddcctl -h` for some options.  
[ddcctl.sh](/ddcctl.sh) is a script I use to control two PC monitors plugged into my Mac Mini.  
You can point Alfred, ControlPlane, or Karabiner at it to quickly switch presets.
