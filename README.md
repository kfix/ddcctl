# ddcctl: DDC monitor controls for the OSX command line #
Adjust your external monitors' built-in controls from the OSX shell:

* brightness
* contrast

And *possibly* (if your monitor firmware is well implemented):

* input source
* built-in speaker volume
* on/off/standby
* rgb colors
* color presets
* reset

# Project Status #
This is a GPLv3 open source repo and you may use it in the ways that license allows.  

It is not a Community "Free Software" Project - its decidedly my personal utility and its in the (dreaded/loved) _"maintenance mode"_.

# Reporting issues #
To be blunt, if you have issues with your macOS, Macintosh (not hackintosh), and DDC-controlled monitor(s), then its up to *_you_* to debug them and (optionally) PR your fixes (see bottom section) if you'd like to share them.  

I don't have the time currently to triage new Issues and help with the non-bugs being reported, and don't intend to moderate a support or discussion forum here.  

# Installation #

## Option 1: Install via Homebrew ##
Open a terminal window and run `$ brew install ddcctl`.

## Option 2: Download Binaries ##
Head to [Releases](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl/releases) and from the
[latest release](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl/releases/latest) download
[`ddcctl_binaries.zip`](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl/releases/latest/download/ddcctl_binaries.zip)
archive

## Option 3: Build from Source ##
* install Xcode
* run `make`

# Usage #
Run `ddcctl -h` for some options.  
[ddcctl.sh](/scripts/ddcctl.sh) is a script I use to control two PC monitors plugged into my Mac Mini.  
You can point Alfred, ControlPlane, or Karabiner at it to quickly switch presets.

# Input Sources #
When setting input source, refer to the table below to determine which value to use.  
For example, to set your first display to HDMI: `ddcctl -d 1 -i 17`.

| Input Source | Value        |
| ------------- |-------------|
| VGA-1 | 1 |
| VGA-2 | 2 |
| DVI-1 | 3 |
| DVI-2 | 4 |
| Composite video 1 | 5 |
| Composite video 2 | 6 |
| S-Video-1 | 7 |
| S-Video-2 | 8 |
| Tuner-1 | 9 |
| Tuner-2 | 10 |
| Tuner-3 | 11 |
| Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 1 | 12 |
| Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 2 | 13 |
| Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 3 | 14 |
| DisplayPort-1 | 15 |
| DisplayPort-2 | 16 |
| HDMI-1 | 17 |
| HDMI-2 | 18 |
| USB-C | 27 |

# Credits #
`ddcctl.m` sprang from a [forum thread](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/controlling-your-monitor-with-osx-ddc-panel.90077/page-6#post-795208) on the TonyMac-x86 boards.

`DDC.c` originated from [jontaylor/DDC-CI-Tools-for-OS-X](https://github.com/jontaylor/DDC-CI-Tools-for-OS-X), but was reworked by others on the forums.  

A few forks have also backported patches, which is *nice* :ok_hand:.

# Contributing PRs #

bug-fix & non-bug-fix/feature PRs have the same broad guidelines:
* well described as to the universal utility of the change for the (presumed) majority of users / developers
  * or a positive proof that the change doesn't detract from the usability for the majority of users
* easy to test
  * provide _your_ test procedure, if you have one!
  * keep in mind my verification is always manual - I don't have a CI system wired up to a bank of real Macs & monitors

As to additional criteria for new-features, please understand that `ddcctl` currently does what _I need it to do_ on my own all-Apple fleet.

There is a [backlog](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl/projects/1) of some (broadly desirable) features that came from reported issues. PRs are encouraged to address these!  

I'm not really interested in adding any features that I have no ability or desire to support on my own hardware.  

Unfortunately, I cannot make a time-to-review estimation - but the simpler/cleaner a PR is, the the faster its likely to get reviewed & merged.
